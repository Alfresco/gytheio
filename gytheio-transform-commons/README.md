Overview
========

Contains the basic definitions of the transformation option objects 
to be used by `ContentTransformerWorker`s.

Note that classes brought from AlfrescoOne were kept as close to their originals
as possible, primarily to aid in the marshalling process without having to make changes
to existing AlfrescoOne code.  Items could be changed/renamed more appropriately
and without reference to 'repository' once AlfrescoOne is refactored to use this project.
