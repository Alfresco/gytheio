Overview
========

Contains the basic definitions of `TransformationRequest` and `TransformationReply`
objects and the transformation option objects to be sent to content transformers.

Note that classes brought from AlfrescoOne were kept as close to their originals
as possible, primarily to aid in the marshalling process without having to make changes
to existing AlfrescoOne code.  Items could be changed/renamed more appropriately
and without reference to 'repository' once AlfrescoOne is refactored to use this project.
