Overview
========

Runs an [ActiveMQ](http://activemq.apache.org) broker.

Usage
=====

To start the broker run:

    mvn activemq:run
    
You can then access the [admin console](http://localhost:8161/admin)
with a username/password of admin/admin.

If you want to see the logging message you'll have to specify the path in the command:

    mvn activemq:run -Dlog4j.configuration=file:///<full path to log4j.properties>

As of now, runs ActiveMQ 5.17 (note: build & run with JDK 17). 

Alternatively, you may choose use docker, for example:

    https://hub.docker.com/r/webcenter/activemq/ (or similar)
